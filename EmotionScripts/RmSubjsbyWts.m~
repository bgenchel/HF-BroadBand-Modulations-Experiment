% takes the 'activations' matrix from 'Emotion Space' decomp and returns subjects without 
% 'highly weighted' (specified by user) factors in the dimensions specified.

% INPUTS:
% activations -- matrix of size (dimensions x factors*subjects)
% subjlist -- vector of size 1 x factors*subjects (# columns of activations matrix) indicating
%             for each column which subject is represented
% dims -- [vector] list of dimensions of decomposition to find highly weighted factors for.
% cutwt -- [vector] one value per dimension listed, uses this value as the threshold for subject 
%          inclusion, else if empty, will use the 1.5*(standard deviation) as the cutoff for each 
%          dimension
