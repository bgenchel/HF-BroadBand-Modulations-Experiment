I have tried the following things to find correlations between
emotion and gamma IMs:

1) correlation via 'matcorr()'and regress()
   results showed only about ~8 IMs with sig correlation by
   p value of regress(). This was only in clusters 1/2, so 
   both brain and muscle had some correlation. Correlation
   was with behavioral ratings of VALENCE, while almost none
   with arousal.

2) I tried just looking at the mean, median IM wts for each
   cluster over all emotions to see if any emotions were more
   affected by any cluster. Though clusters 2,3,4 all had a
   p < .05 from ANOVA1, none showed any specific emotion that
   was significantly different than the others by bonferroni
   post-hoc test.

3) I found which IMs showed any significant differences in
   their mean weights by ANOVA1 and then did a bonferroni
   post hoc test to see which emotions differed from others
   in a pairwise fashion. I quantified the number of times
   each emotion was found in a significantly differentiated
   pair as a measurement of which emotions tended to stand
   out for each IM. Then I looked at the mean, median, and 
   mode values for these measurements in all gamma clusters.
   None of the means or medians were significant, again by 
   ANOVA1 test. The modes look somewhat interesting, but there 
   is no way to do statistics on this measure, and given the
   lack of significance on other measures, it is likely not 
   significant.

4) mutual information between IM weights--calculating
