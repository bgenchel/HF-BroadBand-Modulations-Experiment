I have tried the following things to find correlations between
emotion and gamma IMs:

1) correlation via 'matcorr()'and regress()
   results showed only about ~8 IMs with sig correlation by
   p value of regress(). This was only in clusters 1/2, so 
   both brain and muscle had some correlation. Correlation
   was with behavioral ratings of VALENCE, while almost none
   with arousal.
